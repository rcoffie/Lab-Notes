The Microsoft identity platform helps you build applications your users and customers can sign in to using their Microsoft identities or social accounts. It authorizes access to your own APIs or Microsoft APIs like Microsoft Graph.

## AD Connect 
Azure AD Connect is a tool for connecting on-premises identity infrastructure to Microsoft Azure AD

## Azure Active Directory 
**Microsoft's Azure Active Directory** (shortened Microsoft Azure AD) is a cloud-based solution for managing identity and access. It is a directory and identity management service that operates in the cloud and offers authentication and authorization services to various Microsoft services like Office 365, Dynamics 365, Azure, and cloud-based applications. Azure AD provides users with single sign-on experience, regardless of whether their applications are cloud-based or on-premises.

Azure AD offers many authentication methods, including password-based, multi-factor, smart card, and certificate-based authentication. It also includes several security features, such as conditional access policies, risk-based authentication, and identity protectio

**Azure Active Directory** is Microsoft’s multi-tenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service. For an organization, Azure AD helps employees sign up to multiple services and access them anywhere over the cloud with a single set of login credentials.

## Benefits and Features of Azure AD
**High Availability**  
Microsoft guarantees 99.9% availability. All data is first written to the Active Primary partition, and then replicated to the Passive Primary, and then to the Secondary Replica partitions, from which data is read. In total, Microsoft has 28 data centers spread across multiple geographic regions.

**Strong Azure AD Security**  
As you would expect, Microsoft takes security very seriously. Azure AD has a number of security features, which include Multi Factor Authentication, Conditional Access and Privileged Identity Management (PIM), to name a few.

**Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) in Azure AD**  
MFA provides an extra layer of security to accounts by requesting an additional form of verification. Azure AD provides the following MFA verification methods:

* Microsoft Authenticator app
* OATH Hardware token
* OATH Software token
* SMS
* Voice call

**Conditional Access**  
You can set up Conditional Access policies to ensure that users are only granted access to the data they need to perform their role. These policies are basically if-then statements, which can check for a wide range of signals, including user or group membership, IP location, devices and applications used, and more. It is also possible for admins to set up a ‘Dynamic Group’, where group membership will automatically change based on certain attributes, such as employee type, location, department, and more.

**Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Azure AD**
Azure AD PIM enables fine-grained control over privileged accounts and the resources they have access to. This feature also provides an audit trail which will help administrators identify suspicious privileged account activity.

**Easy Integration**  
Azure AD supports a large number of identity providers, which means that users can log in to Azure AD using their Microsoft, Google, Facebook, or GitHub accounts. Additionally, Azure AD can be integrated into a wide range of apps, such as Salesforce, Office 365, and more. The Azure AD API can be easily integrated into applications built using a wide range of programming languages, such as .NET, Java, Python, and Ruby. It can also be integrated into mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS.

**Single Sign-on (SSO)**  
Azure AD’s SSO feature enables users to login to multiple applications via a single pane, which includes both SaaS and on-premises applications. The SSO feature makes it easier for administrators to add new users and services without needing to set up credentials or security groups for each application or service.

**Central Management of Applications and Users**  
Azure AD can simplify management by providing a central location to manage all your users and applications. You can use Azure AD to create and manage user accounts, assign permissions, and control access to applications. Azure AD also provides a self-service password reset feature that can help reduce IT support costs since password resets are the number one help desk request.
