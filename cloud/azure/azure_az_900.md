### Describing cloud computing

### What is cloud computing 
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

#### Types of cloud computing 
There are four main types of cloud computing 
Private cloud 
public cloud 
hybrid cloud 
Multi cloud

### Private Cloud 
A private cloud is a service that is completely controlled by a single organization and not shared with others, this is dedicated to a single company
#### Benefits 
* Agility 
* Private Network 
* Can be used without intetnet access 
* Can help control cost 
#### Drawbacks 
* If infrastructure is owned, cost can be high 
* May not be able to effectively control access to data 

### Public Cloud 
A public cloud is a subscription service that is also offered to any and all customers who want similar services, this is a shared Infrastructure provided by the cloud provider 

#### Benefits 
* Agility 
* Quick deployment to the cloud 
* Easy management 
* Cost control 

#### Drawbacks 
* Some loss of control 
* Security and regulatory requirements 
* Some loss of flexibility 
* Shared Infrastructure 

### Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is a mixed computing environment where applications are run using a combination of computing, storage, and services in different environments—public clouds and private clouds, including on-premises data centers or “edge” locations

#### Benefits 
* Keep some systems on premises 
* Better support for legacy systems 
* Maintain control over data and infrastructure

#### Drawbacks 
* Techincally complex to connect systems 
* Compatibility of data 
* Addional IT expertise required 

### What is a Multi CLoud environment
Multicloud is when an organization uses cloud computing services from at least two cloud providers to run their applications. Instead of using a single-cloud stack, multicloud environments typically include a combination of two or more public clouds, two or more private clouds, or some combination of both. By having the freedom to create a strategy that utilizes multiple vendors, you can pick and choose the capabilities that best suit your specific business needs and minimize vendor lock-in. 

### Types of cloud services 
There are three types of cloud services 
Infrastructure as a services (LASS)
Platform as a service (PASS)
Software as a services (SASS)

#### Consumption base model 
This pay-as-you-go model means usage is metered and you pay only for what you consume. The fundamental economics of cloud computing are based around the premise that customers will pay for how long a server is used, or how much bandwidth data is being consumed. 
You pay for resources allocated to you. 

#### How to control consumption base 
* Don't allocate more resoucres than you need
* Ensure you utilize the rsources you allocate 

### Benefits of usein cloud services 
* Accessibility anywhere, with any device
* Centralized data security.
* Higher performance and availability.
* Business continuity
* Availability and Scalability 
* Reliability and Predictability 

#### What makes an application unavailable 
* A netowork outage 
* An application failure 
* A system outage, such as a VM 
* A power outage 

#### Cloud Scalability 
cloud scalability is the ability to increase or decrease IT resoucres as needed to meet changing demand.  

Cloud scalabiliy is the ability of a cloud computing system to adapt to changing computing requirements by either increasing or decreasing it's resources, such as computing power, storage or newtwork capacity on demand. it allows systems to adjust its' resoucres to the workload to meet the required perfomance levels. This scalaiblity often involves increasing or decreasing the number of servers, storage or other computing resources. 

There are two basic types of scalability in cloud computing: vertical and horizontal scaling. With vertical scaling, also known as “scaling up” or “scaling down,” you add or subtract power to an existing cloud server upgrading memory (RAM), storage or processing power (CPU). 

#### Vertical Scaling 
Vertical scaling in cloud computing is adding resources to an existing instance or server to increase its capacity or capabilities. It automatically enables the system to allocate more or fewer resources to meet changing requirements.  Vertical scaling is usually done by increasing the server's computing power, adding more RAM or CPU cores, or adding storage capacities, such as hard disks or solid-state drives. 

Vertical scaling enables your applications to run faster and handle more load without purchasing a new server or instance. And vertical scaling is a popular choice for cloud computing because it is relatively easy to do and does not require any changes to the existing infrastructure.

#### Horizontal Scaling 
Horizontal scaling in cloud computing refers to the ability to scale out a system by adding more nodes, or servers, to the system. This scaling is often used to improve the cluster's processing power, allowing applications and services to handle more concurrent requests or to process more significant amounts of data. 

In cloud computing, horizontal scaling is usually achieved by adding additional virtual machines (VMs), containers, or other resources to an existing cluster. This type of scaling is often used to improve performance or to handle increased traffic. When done correctly, horizontal scaling can be a very effective way to enhance the performance of a system.

#### Diagonal Scaling 
Horizontal scaling in cloud computing refers to the ability to scale out a system by adding more nodes, or servers, to the system. This scaling is often used to improve the cluster's processing power, allowing applications and services to handle more concurrent requests or to process more significant amounts of data. 

In cloud computing, horizontal scaling is usually achieved by adding additional virtual machines (VMs), containers, or other resources to an existing cluster. This type of scaling is often used to improve performance or to handle increased traffic. When done correctly, horizontal scaling can be a very effective way to enhance the performance of a system.

### Key Benefits of Cloud scalaiblity 

* Cost Efficiency: Cloud scalability allows businesses to scale up or down resources according to their needs. This efficiency helps enterprises pay only for the resources they use and adjust their costs as needed. Additionally, cloud scalability can help companies to reduce their IT costs by reducing the need for physical hardware and maintenance personnel.

* Improved Performance: Cloud scalability allows businesses to increase performance and maintain higher levels of customer service by having the capacity to add more resources in response to rising demand immediately. And companies can scale up or down quickly and easily by using the cloud, allowing them to stay agile and competitive.

* Increased Flexibility: With cloud scalability, businesses can easily adjust their resources to stay ahead of the competition and better meet customer needs.

* Increased Reliability: By allowing businesses to scale their resources to meet customer demand, cloud scalability helps to ensure that services remain available and reliable.

* Lower Maintenance Costs: With cloud scalability, businesses can lower their maintenance costs, as they no longer need to worry about managing and maintaining their hardware.

* Improve Power: Scalable cloud services enable businesses to easily add or remove resources as needed, allowing them to adjust to changing demands quickly. This means companies can focus on their core operations and not worry about having enough computing power or storage capacity. With cloud scalability, companies can quickly increase their computing power and storage capacity without investing in additional hardware. This scalability can be especially helpful for businesses that experience unpredictable or seasonal spikes in usage.

#### How to Achieve Cloud Scalability 

Achieving cloud scalability is an essential part of any cloud strategy. Scalability allows you to increase or decrease the resources you need to meet demand without sacrificing performance or availability. To achieve scalability, it is essential to understand the workloads you are running and the resources they require. It is also vital to have a solid strategy for scaling up and down as needed. This strategy includes having a plan for when to add or remove servers and automated processes in place to make scaling easier. 

Additionally, it is vital to have an excellent monitoring system to track usage and ensure that your cloud environment is running optimally. With the right strategy and tools in place, you can ensure that your cloud environment is always performing at its best and able to meet your growing needs.

Cloud scalability can be achieved by combining different technologies and techniques. These include:

1. Load Balancing: Load balancing distributes incoming internet traffic across multiple servers to maximize network efficiency and reduce latency. This balancing helps ensure the server is manageable and keeps performance levels high.

2. Containerization: Containerization is a technology that allows packaging applications into isolated containers that can be scaled up quickly and easily. This containerization provides increased flexibility and scalability of the software.

3. Auto-Scaling: Auto-scaling is a process that automatically adds or removes resources from a system based on actual usage. This auto-scaling ensures that the system can scale up or down to meet the changing needs of the application

4. Resource Allocation: Resource allocation allocates resources to applications to optimize performance. This allocation allows for more efficient use of resources and more effective scaling.

5. Automation: Automation helps to automate tasks, such as provisioning, deployment, and scaling of applications. This automation helps to scale applications without manual intervention quickly. 

6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows developers to define the infrastructure they need and deploy it with a single command. This IaC makes it easier to scale applications quickly.

7. Cloud Monitoring: Cloud monitoring helps to identify bottlenecks and scale up or down resources as needed, which helps to ensure that applications run smoothly even during traffic spikes.

#### what is cloud scalability vs. elsticity ?
* Cloud scalability is the ability of a cloud computing system to handle increased workloads by adding more resources. 

* Elasticity, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to adjust its resources in response to changing workloads dynamically.

#### Cloud Governance 
Cloud governance is a set of rules and policies adopted by companies that run services in the cloud. The goal of cloud governance is to enhance data security, manage risk, and enable the smooth operation of cloud systems.

### Security and Governance 
Security restricts access to your resources to only those you allow 

Governance refers to the level of access someone has , what they can do with that access, and how they can do it .

#### There are three main software services 
* Infrastructure as a service 
* Software as a Services 
* Platform as a serivces 

#### Infrastructure as a Services 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a business model that delivers IT infrastructure like compute, storage, and network resources on a pay-as-you-go basis over the internet. You can use IaaS to request and configure the resources you require to run your applications and IT systems. You are responsible for deploying, maintaining, and supporting your applications, and the IaaS provider is responsible for maintaining the physical infrastructure. Infrastructure as a Service gives you flexibility and control over your IT resources in a cost-effective manner q


#### Platform As a Services
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more.


#### Software as a services 

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), is a cloud based software delivery model that allows end users to access software applications over the internet. With a SaaS model, the software is hosted on remote servers, maintained and updated by the service provider, and made available to customers via web browsers, mobile apps and APIs. SaaS provides a number of user benefits over traditional software delivery models, including reduced upfront costs, scalability, flexibility, and accessibility. As the software is hosted on the service provider's servers, there is no need for users to invest in expensive infrastructure in order to use the software. Instead, the end users pay a subscription fee to access the software as on-demand service.
